## SQL Documentary

Data Manipulation Language (DML):

	INSERT INTO Sales.Order (id, name) VALUES (5, DEFAULT) -- insert id as 5 and name is default you wrote before.
	
	INSERT INTO TABLE (blah, blah)
	SELECT blah blah
	FROM blah
	--This code will take the select result and put it in TABLE

Procedure is a stored query inside DBMS to be used many times.

Scalar function:

	takes one value and return one value
	بتاخد قيمه واحده وترجع قيمه واحده
	ex : upper, lower, length, ceiling --rounds numbers to nearest

Aggregate functions:

	takes multiple values and returns one value
	ex: count, avg, sum, min, max

implicit vs explicit:

	Implicit: is converting by Accident -- like adding float to int or multiply them
	Explicit: turning a datatype into another datatype

	CAST('123' AS INT) 	Turning 123 into integer -- cast is ANSI SQL and hence its more portable
	CONVERT(INT, '12345')
	TRY_CONVERT() -- If Convert is wrong it returns NULL.
	PARSE()
	TRY_PARSE() -- If parse is wrong it returns NULL.
	
Other functions:

	ISNUMERIC: Returns 1 if inpus is number -- SELECT ISNUMERIC('SQL)
	IIF(SALARY>10000 , 'HIGH', 'LOW') -- returns high if true
	CHOOSE(2,'Taha', 'Hema', 'alaa') -- first parameter is used to select >>> result is Hema
	COALEASE (COND1,COND2,COND3,'NOT') -- Returns first non-NULL Value in input.
	NULLIF ()
	
	
Having Vs Where:
	Having is only used with group by and applied to group of rows 
	where is applied to row by row
	

Window Functions:
	All it does is adding another column to the output that can be derived from any function
